# valde-hapi

valde-hapi is a config-driven framework which you can use to produce a working skeleton application
in a few minutes. The resulting skeleton app supports:

```
1-   Web pages based on LinkedIn dust templates
2-   Web pages based on React, with isomorphic rendering
3-   mongodb integration
4-   CSRF protection (using bearer tokens) and session cookies
```

The major version number of this framework will follow the respective one of the hapi framework.
